# recipe-cookbook
This is a Recipe cook-book created with ‚ù§ using React.js

## Tools used

- Figma (UI wireframe and planning)
- React.js
- Flexbox
- Spoonacular API and AXIOS
- Context API
- Hooks used : useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer
- React Router
- Firebase Hosting


## Version
1.0 (few design bugs and not so prominent functional bugs)

## Learning Outcome

This project is purely **data-fetching focused**, especiallly focused on using the **AXIOS api** for getting data from the spoonacularAPI. Also getting a hold of **global state management** using the context api. So, this project deals with **fetching data** from the API, **managing states** between components.

There will be some additional features like "filters" and reponsive design (mobile version) added to this app in the *future*.

## App Description

Inside of the app, you can search for recipes/cuisines/ingredients in the **SearchBar** - Which provides you with a maximum of **5** recipes relevant to the search. The result numbers are limited so as to not exhaust the *API free calls quota* (which will be fixed in the future).  

Furthermore, you can get the details (ingredients needed and cooking instructions) of the recipe you love by clicking the **Get Cooking Info** button.
